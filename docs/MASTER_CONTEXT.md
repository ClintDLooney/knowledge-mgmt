## Content Organization Strategy (2025-01-XX)

### ChatGPT Content Migration Plan
**Status**: Ready for processing and reorganization

#### Target Organization:
- **IAAP Certification content** → `a11y-ai/learning/certification/`
- **Accessibility business strategy** → `a11y-ai/business-mgmt/`
- **Audit tools and SOPs** → `a11y-ai/tools/`
- **Paid Creators business content** → `a11y-ai/business-mgmt/`
- **AI learning materials** → `shared/learning/ai/`
- **Prompt libraries** → `shared/prompts/`
- **Templates and SOPs** → `shared/templates/`

#### Processing Approach:
1. Extract key insights from chat histories
2. Consolidate SOPs from multiple sources
3. Identify reusable templates and workflows
4. Preserve decision context in organized format
5. Maintain original files in archived structure

### Obsidian Vaults Strategy
**Status**: Keep consolidated in current location
- **AI Training Vault** → `obsidian-vaults/AI Training Vault/` (preserve as-is)
- **D&D Content** → `obsidian-vaults/D&D/` (preserve as-is)
- **Rationale**: Corresponds to local Obsidian vault storage location

### Content Processing Priority:
1. **IAAP Certification content** (directly relevant to accessibility business)
2. **AI training vault** (extract most valuable learning materials)
3. **Business strategy consolidation** (merge Paid Creators content)
4. **Create master index** (document where everything lives and why)

## Next Priorities
1. Process and organize ChatGPT content using documented strategy
2. Test OCR tool with larger, more complex documents
3. Scale accessibility business model
4. Develop advanced AI collaboration workflows
