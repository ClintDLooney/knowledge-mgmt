# File Analysis Framework

## Universal File Analysis Process

### Pre-Analysis Setup
1. **File Identification**
   - Document file name, type, size, date
   - Assess file accessibility and format
   - Determine processing approach needed

2. **Context Preparation**
   - Review business domain context
   - Identify relevant success metrics
   - Prepare extraction priorities

### Analysis Phases

#### Phase 1: Content Discovery
- **Purpose**: Understand what the file contains
- **Actions**:
  - Read through entire file
  - Identify main topics and themes
  - Note any obvious structure or organization
  - Flag any immediate red flags

#### Phase 2: Content Categorization
- **Purpose**: Classify content by type and relevance
- **Categories**:
  - **Business Strategy**: Plans, models, frameworks
  - **Product Development**: Specifications, features, processes
  - **Templates/Frameworks**: Reusable structures
  - **Methodology**: Processes, procedures, best practices
  - **Learning**: Insights, lessons, knowledge
  - **Reference**: Supporting information, context

#### Phase 3: Insight Extraction
- **Purpose**: Extract actionable insights and frameworks
- **Actions**:
  - Identify key insights and frameworks
  - Extract reusable templates and processes
  - Note business opportunities and gaps
  - Document learning points

#### Phase 4: Cross-Reference Mapping
- **Purpose**: Connect content to other knowledge areas
- **Actions**:
  - Identify related content in other files
  - Note dependencies and relationships
  - Flag content that belongs in multiple categories
  - Document integration opportunities

### Quality Assurance

#### Validation Checklist
