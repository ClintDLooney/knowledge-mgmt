- Place content in appropriate staging areas
- Update processing logs and mappings
- Pause for review at each file

3.2 Content Integration
- Organize staged content into final structure
- Create comprehensive business strategies
- Integrate with existing business content
- Validate all extractions and frameworks
```

### Phase 4: Integration & Documentation

```markdown
4.1 Learning Documentation
- Document complete processing methodology
- Create reusable SOPs and prompts
- Build domain-agnostic frameworks
- Prepare for future knowledge processing

4.2 Final Integration
- Organize processed content into target structure
- Create comprehensive business strategies
- Validate all extractions and frameworks
- Prepare for final approval
```

## Content Prioritization Strategy

**Processing Order:**

1. **Highest Relevance (Start Here):** Central guiding documents, direct business strategy
2. **High Relevance:** Core business documents, frameworks, tools
3. **Medium Relevance:** Supporting documents, templates, workflows
4. **Lower Relevance (Process Later):** Generic content, examples, miscellaneous

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Validation Checkpoints
- After each file analysis
- At any uncertainty or WTF moments
- When switching tasks or gears
- At potential red flags or issues
- Before major processing decisions

### Red Flag Detection Patterns
- Content that seems irrelevant or useless
- Processing approach inefficiencies
- Quality degradation or information loss
- Business alignment issues
- Technical or structural problems
- File access or format issues

### Learning Documentation Requirements
- Complete methodology documentation
- Reusable prompt templates
- Domain-agnostic processing methods
- Case study documentation
- Future knowledge processing guides

## Processing Logs & Tracking

### Required Log Files
- `processing-log.md` - Overall progress and decisions
- `extraction-mapping.md` - Content to destination mapping
- `red-flags-log.md` - Issues and resolutions
- `content-inventory.md` - File metadata and relevance scores
- `learning-documentation.md` - Methodology insights and improvements

### Log Entry Format

```markdown
## [Date] - [File/Phase] - [Status]
**Action**: [What was done]
**Findings**: [Key insights discovered]
**Decisions**: [Decisions made]
**Red Flags**: [Issues identified]
**Next Steps**: [What to do next]
**Learning**: [Methodology insights]

## Restart & Recovery Procedures

### Fresh Chat Context Loading Prompt

I need to process [knowledge-body-name] content for my [business-domain] business. Here's the complete context:

**Project Goal**: Extract business insights, frameworks, and create reusable knowledge processing SOPs from [knowledge-body-name] content.

**Current State**:
- Archive content preserved in archive/[location]/
- Processing workspace ready at km-processing/[knowledge-body-name]-copy/
- Learning documentation framework in shared/learning/knowledge-processing/

**Approach**:
1. File-by-file analysis with high detail
2. Topic-by-topic synthesis for pattern recognition
3. Destructive processing in staging area
4. Integration with [target-integration-directory]

**Key Files to Read First**:
- docs/MASTER_CONTEXT.md - Overall project context
- [business-context-file] - Business context
- km-processing/[knowledge-body-name]-copy/processing-log.md - Current progress
- shared/learning/knowledge-processing/master-sop.md - Processing methodology

**Success Criteria**: Complete conversion to actionable business strategies + comprehensive learning documentation for future knowledge processing.

**Validation**: Pause after each file, at uncertainties, and at red flags for review and guidance.

## Domain-Agnostic Learning Documentation

The learning documentation is designed for reuse across different knowledge domains:

```markdown

├── master-sop.md (complete methodology)
├── prompt-templates/
│   ├── knowledge-body-analysis.md
│   ├── content-extraction.md
│   ├── pattern-recognition.md
│   └── integration-planning.md
├── domain-agnostic-methods/
│   ├── file-analysis-framework.md
│   ├── content-categorization.md
│   ├── extraction-validation.md
│   └── red-flag-detection.md
└── case-studies/

    └── [future case studies]
```

## Binary File Access Issue Resolution

**Problem**: Binary files (Word docs, PDFs) cannot be read directly
**Solutions Available**:
1. Manual conversion to text format
2. OCR processing (if tool is mature enough)
3. Alternative text extraction tools
4. Hybrid approach (process accessible content first)
5. Alternative strategy (focus on text-based archives first)

**Recommendation**: Determine approach based on content priority and available tools
