Taken by [[Isolde]] as a young man and turned into a [[Vampire]] by means of her experimental transmutative magics. Aon agreed to undergo the change to save his lover [[Tisha Blacklake]], whose disease was engineered secretly by Isolde for the purposes of manipulating Aon. 

* Notable Appearances
	* [[Citadel Floor 1 (Episode) (Working Title)]] - Aon was present in the Daughter's Chapel, hanging from the ceiling when the party came in through the eastern window. The party destroyed his body, and he escaped in mist form. 
	* [[Pid Fiend Rush (Episode) (Working Title)]] - Appeared as a challenge fight from the Bloody Feather, and got hilariously butchered by the party. 
	* [[Blacklake Ball-Break (Episode) (Working Title)]] - Aon hosted the gala the party broke into. They destoyed his body, hunted him to his coffin, and finally killed him.
