A psychological contaminant created when [[Jeremiah Rosenfield]] extracted his brain matter as part of the process of becoming a Lich. The New Alchemy can infect a substance or creature with Eschaton's mind, and a corrupted person who passes from one age to the next carries the corruption of New Alchemy with them. 

When outside a host, the New Alchemy exhibits limited sentience and a violent aggression toward [[The Formless]] and all its agents. 

Notable hosts include 
* [[Morsch Green-Eye]], who was infected by the [[Mind of Evil]] during the [[Battle of Rock's Deep (Working Title)]]
* [[Isolde]], who was infected by [[Jeremiah Rosenfield]] across ages.
