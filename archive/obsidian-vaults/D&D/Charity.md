An ancient silver [[Dragon]] from [[The Third Age]], [[True Shadow]] of the First Frost. Former member of the [[Timpani Imperial Vanguard]] and best friends with [[Kylie Brightborn]].

Charity received the [[Brand of Eschaton]] during the [[Fourth Age]], which enabled her corruption by [[Eschaton]] in the [[Fifth Age]]. The party fought her and [[Ravistad]], at which point Morsch cut her wings off with [[Fang of the First Frost]]

Received blessings of forgetfulness from the [[Maiden of Loss]] by asking Kylie to pray away her memories of her children, lost in battle with [[Tiamat]]'s agents in both the [[The Third Age]] and [[The Fourth Age]].
