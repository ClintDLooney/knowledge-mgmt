[[Shadows (Campaign)]]
[[Shadows NPC]]
[[Flintlock's Nightmare Room]]
[[Warlock]]
Owner of the [[Glassbottom Observatory]] and reformed [[Brotherhood of Agony]] cultist atoning for the ritual murder of his brother. Upon the death of [[Flintlock's Master (Working Title)]], Flintlock adopted his master's [[Red Dragon Pact (Working Title)]] with [[Bastille]], becoming a Draconic pact [[Warlock]]. 

Flintlock's growing strength in [[Pact Magic]] attracted [[Isolde]]'s attention, and she traded him knowledge and power for his assistance in her experiments. His deep research into monster behavior, anatomy, and arcane attributes proved helpful in her transmutative and mutagenic research, and she encouraged him down this avenue. At this time, Flintlock took on a new active pact with Isolde. She learned about Flintlock's  pact with Bastille, and the magical secrets she stole from him formed the basis of the [[False God Gambit (Working Title)]]. 

Flintlock broke with Isolde several years before [[Shadowfall]], not suspecting her theft of his grimoire's contents. He severed himself from her pact ties, removing his Warlock levels and starting again as a [[Wizard]].
