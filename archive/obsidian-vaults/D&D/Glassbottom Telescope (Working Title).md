This [[Legendary Artifact]] magical-mechanical telescope occupies the top floor of the [[Glassbottom Observatory]]'s tower. It provides clear, zoomable view of any object in [[Line of Sight]], no matter how distant, limited only by the curvature of the planet. Powerful enchantments enable the user to extend any sensory or [[Divination]] spells and effects through the telescope, giving them indefinite visual range.
