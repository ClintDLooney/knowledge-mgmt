The battle between the [[Shadows of Petersbridge (Working Title)]], [[Bao'Thel]], and [[Threshenne]] and Bao'Thel's other [[Pit Fiend]]s. An attempt by Bao'Thel to force a choice between defending the [[Nought Estate]] and the [[Citadel of the Four]]. The party fought across all 3 lanes, ending together at the crossroads with Bao'Thel. Ended with [[Chu'Chulain]] flying the near-detonation [[Black Shiver]] bomb into the sky to detonate it safely out of range.
