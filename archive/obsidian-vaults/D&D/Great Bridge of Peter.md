A bridge from the Timpani landmass across the [[Bay of Timpani]]. The bridge becomes a road overland south of the Timpani crossing, and continues as a road into [[Petersbridge]], at which point it serves as both bridge and road through the center of the city. 

The most notable part of the  Petersbridge portion of the Great Bridge is [[Peter's Point]], the North/South bridge over the [[Pellucid River]]. A great Status of [[Knight Saint Peter]] decorates the bridge square, with statues of other Petersbridge founders arrayed along the bridgerails.
