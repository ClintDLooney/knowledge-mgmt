* Deep learning successes
	* [[Computer Vision]]
		* [[Image Classification]]/Object Recognition
			* [[Face Recognition]]
		* [[Object Detection]] Unlike Image Classification, which classifies the whole image, object detection tells where in the image objects are, and what type of object each detected object is.
		* [[Image Segmentation]] Classifies whether every given pixel is a part of an object and which object. 
		* [[Tracking]] Taking video and showing the trajectory of moving objects detected. Idea: Use tracking to map page flow of screen reader/keyboard. 
	* [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]] 
		* [[Text Classification]] i.e. spam checking emails, product category prediction
			* [[Sentiment Recognition]] How many stars is this review text likely to result in?
			* [[Information Retrieval]] Web search, internal database search/doc review etc. 
			* [[Name Entity Recognition]] Finding the names of noun things in text. For instance, identifying all the people in a passage or all cars mentioned. Companies, countries, recognizing phone numbers. Maybe identifying game mechanics? 
			* [[Machine Translation]] Live captioning, live translation, etc. 
	* [[Speech Applications of ML]]
		* [[Speech Recognition (Speech to Text]] VERY useful for a11y. 
			* [[Trigger Word/Wake Word Detection]]
			* [[Speaker Identification]] Is this meeting sentence vocalized by Clint? Or Evan? 
		* [[Speech Synthesis]] AKA Text to Speech/TTS. Turning a text file into an audio file. 
* [[Generative AI]] A collectino of AI systems which produce output media in various modes. Generally text, images, or audio.
	* [[Text Generation]]
	* [[Image Generation]] [[Midjourney]], [[Dall-E]], [[Adobe Firefly AI]][[StableDiffusion]]
	* [[Audio Generation]] Includes Sybol's [[Stable Audio]], or Meta's [[AudiCraft]]. Can generate audio including music and sound effects. 
* [[Robotics Applicatoins of AI]]
	* [[Perception (Robotics)]] - Figuring out what's in the environment based on artificail sense data. 
	* [[Motion Planning]] Finding a path for a robot to follow. 
	* [[Control (Robotics)]] Sending commands to devices to effectuate motion. 
* [[General Applications of ML]] 
	* Unstructured Data uses: Images, video, audio, text.
	* Structured Data: Databases etc. Tends to be more silo'd within a given company, as companies rarely share their structured data.
