A [[Supervised Machine Learning]] algorithm used for [[Multi-Class Classification]]. It classifies new data points based on the closest data points in the training set.
The algorithm plots new data and compares it to pre-existing data. 
Minimizing distance between neighbros is important to KNN, and the most common technique for this is [[Euclidian Distance]].
If we use a K of 5, that means we put a circle around the new datum and its 5 nearest neighbors. 
KNN is often used in finance to analyze stocks and predict performance. 
//TODO understand in with more practical/intujitive examples.
