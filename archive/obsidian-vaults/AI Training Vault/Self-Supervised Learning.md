A technique where AI systems use known data to make educated guesses about unknown data, creating [[Pseudo Labels]] for unstructured data. Allows accurate data labeling with minimal human intervention. Self-supervised learning is the key technique used to create [[Generative AI]] systems. 

Useful when you have a massive amount of unstructured data. Most companies can't even afford the compute to deal with this much data. This approach is expensive, but generates enormous learning power. 
This method moves beyond predictive models and predictive AI. 

Process: 
1. Perform[[Unsupervised Machine Learning]] to cluster similar data together. 
2. Uses another form of unsupervised learning to look for other data to help it make guesses. It'll use this data as a Rosetta stone to classify data. 
3. Generate pseudo labels on unlabeled data. 
4.
