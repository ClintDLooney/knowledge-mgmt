Uses [[Reward Signals]] to tell the AI when it's doing well vs. poorly, and the AI automatically learns to maximize its rewards. (Hopefully leading to more desirable behavior.) 

Has been used to train autonomous vehicles (Stanford autonomous helicopter), and it's good for learning to play games. 

Weakness: Reinforcement learning takes a huge amount of data.
