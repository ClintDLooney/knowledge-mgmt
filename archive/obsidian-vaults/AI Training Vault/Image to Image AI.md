[[Discriminative AI]]
//TODO Collapse article content into discriminative AI note. 

These models are usually created using a machine learning model with 2 neural networks, 1 generator and 1 discriminator. 
* Generator is trained on a real image dataset. This network creates the images. 
* Discriminator: Trained on same dataset, meant to determine if the imagers are real or AI generated. 
* 
Harder to train than text to image AI because a picture's worth a thousand words and they have to learn relationships between complex visual traits like shape and texture. 

Image to image tends to create more realistic images, since it's working with an existing image it can be consistent wth. 
Good when you're looking for specific results. 
Good for shopping photos or generating new images based on your existing photos. You can change lighting of a photo, upres photos, restore or enhance shitty photos, etc. You can color black & white photos. You can transplant styles from other images--paintings, pictures, whatever. 
You can CHANGE A BAD SKETCH into a full image.
