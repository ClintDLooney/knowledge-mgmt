Each algorithm primarily excels at either [[Supervised Machine Learning]] or [[Unsupervised Machine Learning]], but some algorithms can be used for both. 

* [[Supervised Machine Learning]] algorithms learn A to B mappings. And you have to tell the algorithm what output B you wan.t Uses Labeled data, labels are the desired target output B. 
	* Criticism: Supervised needs a LOT of labeled data. 
* [[Unsupervised Machine Learning]] does not tell the algorithm what output it wants. It just feeds in a bunch of data and has the algorithm extract patterns or inferences from it. 
	* Hope of the future for ML to work better and without such need for labeled data. 
	* Current value is less than that of supervised ML, though future value may be greater.
