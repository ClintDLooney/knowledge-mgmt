- A supervised machine learning algorithm that looks at the relationship between [[Predictors]] (input variables) and the outcome.
- You take the training data and label the correct output. 
- Involves using training data to make predictions and then refining those predictions by comparing them to actual outcomes.

- Regression analysis doesn't tell you why a trend emerges, it just identifies the trend. 
- ML regression algorithms take training data, and make predictions. Then they see how close they are to theactual outcome. Then they iterate until their predictions are very accurate.
