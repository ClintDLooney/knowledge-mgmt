Learns input-output mappings. 
Supervised learning is at the heart of [[Generative AI]] systems. 
A type of machine learning where a system is trained on a labeled dataset. A data scientist acts like a tutor, showing the machine the correct answers and allowing it to learn from these examples.
Relies on human supervision and [[Labeled Data]]
In supervised learning, you separate your data into: 
* A training set: A smaller, labeled data set the ML algorithm uses to learn. 
* A test set: Test set is unlabeled and generally many times larger than the training set. Once the algorithm has learned enough from the training set, you can apply it to the test set. 
Once you're satisfied with the algorithm's performance against the test set, the algorithm is your initial data model. 
- **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms**: Examples include K nearest neighbor, regression analysis, and naive bayes, primarily used for classification.

you don't need humans to manually label data in order ot use supervised learning. So what, machine labeling? //TODO
