Bias is how far from the bullseye you are. Variance is how tight your groupign is. 
If you have a tight grouping way off the center, that's high bias low variance. 
An LM system can usually focus high bias or high variance, but not both.  This is called the [[Bias Variance Tradeoff]].
Decreasing variance tends to increase bias, and vice versa.
