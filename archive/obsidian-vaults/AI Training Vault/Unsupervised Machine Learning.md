 A method where AI systems analyze and cluster unstructured data without predefined labels to find patterns and similarities.

A type of [[Machine Learning]] where the system learns from an unlabeled dataset. The machine makes observations on its own without guidance, identifying patterns and structures in the data.
Uses [[Unlabeled Data]].
- **Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms**: Examples include K nearest neighbor, regression analysis, and naive bayes, primarily used for classification.
