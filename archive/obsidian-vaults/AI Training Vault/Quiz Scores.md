Question 1

Machine learning is an “iterative” process, meaning that an AI team often has to try many ideas before coming up with something that’s good enough, rather than have the first thing they try work.

True

False

Correct

In machine learning, a lot of iteration is often required before getting to the best result.

Question 2

Say you want to use Machine Learning to help your sales team with automatic lead sorting. I.e., Input A (a sales prospect) and output B (whether your sales team should prioritize them). The 3 steps of the workflow, in scrambled order, are:

(i) Deploy a trained model and get data back from users

(ii) Collect data with both A and B

(iii) Train a machine learning system to input A and output B

What is the correct ordering of these steps?

(i) (iii) (ii)

(ii) (iii) (i)

(ii) (i) (iii)

(i) (ii) (iii)

Correct

This is the correct ordering of the workflow. Collecting data with both input A and output B, followed by training a machine learning system, and finally deploying the trained model.

Question 3

What are the key steps of a Data Science project?

Collect data

Analyze the data

Suggest hypothesis or actions

All of the above

Correct

All three options—collecting data, analyzing the data, and suggesting hypotheses or actions—are key steps in a Data Science project. They form a comprehensive and iterative process.

Question 4

Machine learning programs can help: (select all that apply)

Automate visual inspection in a manufacturing line

Correct

Machine learning techniques, like image recognition and pattern detection, can significantly enhance the automation of visual inspection in a manufacturing line.

Automate lead sorting in sales

Correct

Machine Learning can play an important role in automating lead sorting in sales, streamlining the process and enabling sales teams to focus on high-priority opportunities.

Automate resume screening

Correct

Machine Learning can highly improve the resume screening process and make it more efficient and objective, using machine learning techniques like natural language processing techniques or predictive analysis.

Customize product recommendations

Correct

Machine learning can play an important role in customizing product recommendations by analyzing user behavior, preferences, and historical data.

Question 5

Unless you have a huge dataset (“Big Data”), it is generally not worth attempting machine learning or data science projects on your problem.

True

False

Correct

Even with smaller datasets, venturing into machine learning or data science projects is worthwhile. Contemporary techniques, such as data augmentation, have been developed to address challenges related to dataset size constraints.

Question 6

Say you want to build an AI system to help recruiters with automated resume screening. Which of these steps might be involved in the “technical diligence” process? (Select all that apply.)

Making sure that an AI system can meet the desired performance

Correct

Ensuring that an AI system can meet the desired performance standards is a relevant step in technical diligence.

Making sure you can get enough data for this project

Correct

Checking the availability and adequacy of data is a critical aspect of technical diligence.

Defining an engineering timeline

Ensuring that this is valuable for your business (e.g., estimating the project ROI)

Question 7

Which of these statements about “business diligence” do you agree with?

Business diligence is the process of ensuring that the AI technology, if it is built, is valuable for your business.

Business diligence can typically be completed in less than a day.

Business diligence is the process of ensuring that the envisioned AI technology is feasible.

Business diligence applies only if you are launching new product lines or businesses.

Correct

Business diligence involves evaluating the potential value and impact of the AI technology on your business, ensuring alignment with business objectives.

Question 8

You want to use supervised learning for automated resume screening. Which of the following statements about the training set are true? (Select all that apply.)

It should give examples of the input A (resume) but not necessarily the desired output B (whether to move forward with a candidate).

The training set and test set can be the same dataset.

It will be used by the AI team to train the supervised learning algorithm.

Correct

The training set is indeed used by the AI team to train the supervised learning algorithm, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships between the input and output.

It should give examples of both the input A (resume) and the desired output B (whether to move forward with a candidate).

Correct

In supervised learning, a well-structured training set should include examples where both the input (resume) and the desired output (whether to move forward with a candidate) are known.

Question 9

For your automated resume screening application, you are now providing a test set to the AI team. Which of the following statements about the test set are true? (Select all that apply.)

The test set should ideally be identical to the training set.

It will be used by the AI team to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.

Correct

The test set is specifically used by the AI team to assess and evaluate the performance of the algorithm by comparing the algorithm’s outputs to the known, true outputs.

It should give examples of both the input A (resume) and the desired output B (whether to move forward with a candidate)

It should give examples of the input A (resume) but not necessarily the desired output B (whether to move forward with a candidate).

This should not be selected

The test set plays a fundamental role in evaluating the performance of the algorithm, and known A to B mappings are required. You can revisit the lesson “Working with an AI team” to deepen your understanding about the test set.

Question 10

Which of these are reasons that it’s often unrealistic to expect an ML system to be 100% accurate?

You might not have enough data

Data can be mislabeled

Data can be ambiguous

All of the above.

Correct

All the reasons mentioned—insufficient data, mislabeled data, and data ambiguity—contribute to the challenge of achieving 100% accuracy in machine learning systems.
