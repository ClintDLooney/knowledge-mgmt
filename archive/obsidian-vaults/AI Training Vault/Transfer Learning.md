Learning on one task, then using the knowledge gained to help with a different taks. 

Transfer Learning excels when, after learning from a very large dataset like 10K images of cards, it's applied  to a smaller dataset for generalization, like 100 pictures of golf carts. The first task already resulted in learning what related concepts like cheels and vehicles are, in this example. 

Many [[Computer Vision]] systems are built using Transfer Learning.
