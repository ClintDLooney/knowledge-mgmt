Copyrights automatically protect original works of authorship. 
Copyrighting is automatic upon the creation of a work. You only need to register a copyright if you intend to sue another for copyright infringement. 
As of my 6.2.2025 viewing of https://www.linkedin.com/learning/generative-ai-skills-for-creative-content-opportunities-issues-and-ethics/issues-around-copyright-and-content-ownership?autoSkip=true&resume=false
the US Copyright Office holds that AI generated images AREN'T protectable under copyright, because they're not original human authorships. 
So if you prompt-generate AI art, you can't register it for copyright.
