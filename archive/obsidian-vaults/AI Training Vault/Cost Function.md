Measures the "wrongness" of the neural network's predictions. A smaller cost = a prediction close to the correct answer, larger cost indicates a significant error. 
If the network gives a 99% chance of a photo being a cat but it's a fire hydrant, that's a high Cost. 
Higher costs indicate the system must make greater weight and bias adjustments.
