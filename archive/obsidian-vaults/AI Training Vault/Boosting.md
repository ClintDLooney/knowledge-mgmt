Boosting is a technique in machine learning where algorithms are applied sequentially to improve the accuracy of predictions. Here's how it works:  
  

- **Step-by-Step Improvement**: Each new model tries to correct the errors made by the previous ones.
- **Enhanced Results**: By focusing on the mistakes of prior models, boosting aims to create a strong overall model with better accuracy.
Boosting specifically involves applying algorithms sequentially, where each new model corrects the errors of the previous ones, leading to a stronger overall model.
