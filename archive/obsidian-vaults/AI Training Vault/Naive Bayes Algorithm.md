Called naive because it assumes all [[Predictors]] are independent from each other. 
For instance, the features used as predictors for houses might be size, cost, and location. Naive bayes assuems these factors are not related, even if this is inaccurate. 
Once you've set up your classes and predictors, the algorithm will do [[Class Predictor Probability]], assuming the independence of each predictor. 

Because it makes so few assumptions, Naive Bayes can look at a ton of predictors.
