A [[Data Model]] is fine-tuned for a specific task. 
A [[Foundation Model]] 

Foundation models can sometimes be used to make predictions, but data models CANNOT be used to make genAI systems. 
Foundation models are powerful and flexible, data models are streamlined and  trained for a single task. 

- **Foundation Models**:  
    - Can perform a wide range of tasks without needing retraining.
    - Use self-supervised learning to psudo-label data with minimal human intervention.
    - Are flexible and can be used for generative AI systems.
    - Handle vast amounts of information with pseudo labels.
- **Data Models**:  
    - Are fine-tuned for a specific task.
    - Require retraining when new data is added.
    - Are streamlined and specialized for one particular function.
    - Cannot be used to create generative AI systems.
