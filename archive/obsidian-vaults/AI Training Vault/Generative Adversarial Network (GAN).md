GANs don't use self-supervised learning or a foundation model. They can operate on just [[Supervised Machine Learning]] and [[Unsupervised Machine Learning]].

A system that uses two neural networks, a [[Generator]] and a [[Discriminator]], to create photorealistic images. The generator creates images, while the discriminator evaluates them for authenticity. 

Not just used for images. 

# GANs and Images
GANs can create very photorealistic images. 
* Conts
	* One of the downsides is the Discriminator can only classify images of the type it's been trained on. 
	* Another downside is you can't use GAs for compositions. Only images trained on existing photos. 
* Pros
	* GANs don't rely on a foundation model. This means they're easier to set up and need much less data.
