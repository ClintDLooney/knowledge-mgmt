Create a short trailer for an Amerime-style Gothic horror serial show called Grimoire. Begin with a young Scandanvaian-looking woman taking dictation for an old bed-ridden man. She asks, "What should it say?" and sets quill to page. As the old man answers, his voiceover is played over a montage of Victorian-flavored monster hunting and humans strugglignf for sruvival amidst a terrible plague. It should include scenes of men fighting monsters such as werewolves and vampires, rescuing human villagers, maintaining their pistols nad blades, etc. The old man's voiceover lines are: "It should say...God gave me a mind, and I will use it. I will shine the light of captive electricity into the dark. I will fight with gunpowder, press-forged steel, and all the platns of His creation to counteract the Plague. I wll save the lives of those I amy...by surgery, by medicines, by fellowship and the Word as a light against despair. I will not falter, though I die. I am a man of science. I am..."   The young woman asks, "Arthur?" The visual montage ends, and shows the old man's face. He said "I am a man of God." The scene cuts to the word "Grimoire" on a dark title screen, with a candle flame for the dot on the "i" The flame blows out, and a curl of smoke rises form it. The scene ends.
