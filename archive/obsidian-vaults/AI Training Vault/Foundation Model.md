An AI model capable of performing a wide range of tasks without needing retraining on new data.
Foundation models are very flexible, but require a lot of data. 

1. You can use [[Unsupervised Machine Learning]] to cluster similar data.
2. Use [[Supervised Machine Learning]] to create [[Pseudo Labels]] for these clusters. 
3. Build a foundation model of huge amounts of psudo-labeled data. 

Massive pseudo-labeled datasets make foundation models flexible, but allows [[Hallucination]].
