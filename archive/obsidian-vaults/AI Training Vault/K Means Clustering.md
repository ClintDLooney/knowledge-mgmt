- **K-means clustering**: An unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to create clusters based on data.
- **Clusters**: Groups formed based on similarities in the data.
- **Centroid**: A central point in a cluster, initially chosen randomly, around which other data points are grouped.
- **K in K-means**: Represents the number of clusters you want to create.
- **Variance**: The measure of how far data points are from the centroid within a cluster.
- **Outliers**: Data points that do not fit well into any cluster and can affect the clustering process.
