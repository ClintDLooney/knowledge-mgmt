Imagine you're selling shirts
Neurons in the first layer could include
* "Affordability" neuron: performs calculations based on 
	* Inputs = Price neuron, Shipping cost neuron
	* Output = Affordability
* "Awareness" neuron
	* Input = Marketing Budget neuron
	* Output = how aware of the product customers are
* Perceived quality neuron
	* Inputs = Material neuron, Price neuron, Marketing budget neuron
	* Output = Perceived quality

* Model layers
	* Price, Shipping cost, marketing, materials, 
	* Hidden layer = affordability, awareness, perceived quality
	* Output = Demand
