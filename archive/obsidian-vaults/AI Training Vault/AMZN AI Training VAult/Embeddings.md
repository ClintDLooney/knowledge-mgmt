Embeddings are numerical representations of words or tokens, where semantically similar words have similar vector representations.

Embeddings play a crucial role in representing and understanding the meaning of words and language. LLMs are typically trained on vast amounts of text data, and embeddings are used to represent the words or tokens in this data as numerical vectors.
