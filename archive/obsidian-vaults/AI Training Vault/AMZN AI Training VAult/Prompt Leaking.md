Prompt leaking refers to the unintentional disclosure or leakage of the prompts or inputs (regardless of whether these are protected data or not) used within a model. Prompt leaking does not necessarily expose protected data. But it can expose other data used by the model, which can reveal information of how the model works and this can be used against it.
