Generative AI is a subset of deep learning because it can adapt models built using deep learning, but without retraining or fine tuning. Deep learning uses the concept of neurons and synapses similar to how our brain is wired. An example of a deep learning application is Amazon Rekognition which can analyze millions of images, streaming and stored videos within seconds. Amazon Q Developer, an example of a generative AI application, can generate code suggestions in real time based on your comments and existing code.
