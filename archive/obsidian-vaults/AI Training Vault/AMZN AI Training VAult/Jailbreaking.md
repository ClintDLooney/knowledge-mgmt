//TODO Learn to jailbreak models.

Jailbreaking refers to the practice of modifying or circumventing the constraints and safety measures implemented in a generative model or AI assistant to gain unauthorized access or functionality.

When an AI model is developed, it is typically trained with certain ethical and safety constraints in place to prevent misuse or harmful outputs. These constraints can include filtering out explicit or offensive content, restricting access to sensitive information, or limiting the ability to carry out certain actions or commands.

Jailbreaking attempts involve crafting carefully constructed prompts or input sequences that aim to bypass or exploit vulnerabilities in the AI system's filtering mechanisms or constraints. The goal is to "break out" of the intended model limitations.

## Jailbreaking example
