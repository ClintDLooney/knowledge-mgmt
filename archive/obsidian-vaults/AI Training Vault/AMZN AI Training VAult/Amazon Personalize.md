Amazon Personalize is an ML service that developers can use to create individualized recommendations for customers who use their applications.

  

With Amazon Personalize, you provide an activity stream from your application (page views, signups, purchases, and so forth). You also provide an inventory of the items that you want to recommend, such as articles, products, videos, or music. You can choose to provide Amazon Personalize with additional demographic information from your users, such as age or geographic location. Amazon Personalize processes and examines the data, identifies what is meaningful, selects the right algorithms, and trains and optimizes a personalization model that is customized for your data.
