Accelerated development and deployment
Amazon Q Developer (previously Amazon CodeWhisperer) can generate code in real time. Amazon ran a productivity challenge during the preview of CodeWhisperer. Participants who used the service were 27 percent more likely to complete tasks successfully and did so an average of 57 percent faster than those who did not use CodeWhisperer.
SageMaker handles tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. So developers can focus on the application logic and user experience.
Amazon Bedrock provides access to pre-trained models and APIs. So developers can quickly integrate AI capabilities into their applications without the need for extensive training or specialized hardware. This accelerates the development process and permits faster iteration cycles, reducing the time to market for AI-powered applications.
