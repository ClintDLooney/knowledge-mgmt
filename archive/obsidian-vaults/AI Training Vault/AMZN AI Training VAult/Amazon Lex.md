Amazon Lex is a fully managed AI service to design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces into any application using voice and text. Amazon Lex provides the advanced deep learning functionalities of automatic speech recognition (ASR) for converting speech to text, and natural language understanding (NLU) to recognize the intent of the text. This permits you to build applications with highly engaging user experiences and lifelike conversational interactions, and create new categories of products. With Amazon Lex, the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa are now available to any developer. You can efficiently build sophisticated, natural-language conversational bots and voice-enabled interactive voice response (IVR) systems.
