The maximum length setting determines the maximum number of tokens that the model can generate during the inference process. This parameter helps to prevent the model from generating excessive or infinite output, which could lead to resource exhaustion or undesirable behavior. The appropriate value for this setting depends on the specific task and the desired output length. For instance, in natural language generation tasks like text summarization or translation, the maximum length can be set based on the typical length of the target text. In open-ended generation tasks, such as creative writing or dialogue systems, a higher maximum length might be desirable to allow for more extended outputs.
