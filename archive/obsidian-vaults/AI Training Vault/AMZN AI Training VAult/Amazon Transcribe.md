Amazon Transcribe is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) service for automatically converting speech to text. The service can transcribe audio files stored in common formats, like WAV and MP3, with time stamps for every word so that you can quickly locate the audio in the original source by searching for the text. You can also send a live audio stream to Amazon Transcribe and receive a stream of transcripts in real time. Amazon Transcribe is designed to handle a wide range of speech and acoustic characteristics, including variations in volume, pitch, and speaking rate. Customers can use Amazon Transcribe for a variety of business applications, including the following:

- Transcription of voice-based customer service calls
- Generation of subtitles on audio and video content
- Conducting (text based) content analysis on audio and video content
