Accelerated development and deployment
Amazon Q Developer (previously Amazon CodeWhisperer) can generate code in real time. Amazon ran a productivity challenge during the preview of CodeWhisperer. Participants who used the service were 27 percent more likely to complete tasks successfully and did so an average of 57 percent faster than those who did not use CodeWhisperer.
SageMaker handles tasks such as data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. So developers can focus on the application logic and user experience.
Amazon Bedrock provides access to pre-trained models and APIs. So developers can quickly integrate AI capabilities into their applications without the need for extensive training or specialized hardware. This accelerates the development process and permits faster iteration cycles, reducing the time to market for AI-powered applications.

## Scalability and cost optimization

- With pay-as-you-go pricing models, businesses only pay for the resources that they consume. This reduces upfront costs and facilitates efficient resource utilization.
- AWS global infrastructure and distributed computing capabilities permit applications to scale seamlessly across regions and handle large datasets or high-volume traffic.
## Flexibility and access to models

- AWS continuously updates and expands its AI services, providing access to the latest advancements in machine learning models, techniques, and algorithms.
- Amazon Bedrock offers a choice of high-performing FMs from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and AWS, through a single API.

**Cost considerations**

When working with AI and ML services on AWS, it's essential to understand the various cost considerations involved. These trade-offs can impact factors such as responsiveness, availability, redundancy, performance, regional coverage, pricing models, throughput, and the ability to use custom models. To explore these aspects in more detail, choose each of the following flashcards.

Responsiveness & Availability
AWS generative AI services are designed to be highly responsive and available. However, higher levels of responsiveness and availability often come at an increased cost. For example, services with lower latency and higher availability (for example, multi-Region deployment) will typically have higher pricing compared to alternatives with lower performance and availability guarantees. 

Redundancy and Regional coverage
To ensure redundancy and high availability, AWS generative AI services can be deployed across multiple Availability Zones or even across multiple AWS Regions. This redundancy comes with an additional cost, because resources have to be provisioned and data replicated across multiple locations.

Performance
AWS offers different compute options (for example, CPU, GPU, and custom hardware accelerators) for generative AI services. Higher-performance options, such as GPU instances, generally come at a higher cost but can provide significant performance improvements for certain workloads.

Token-based pricing
Many AWS generative AI services, such as Amazon Q Developer and Amazon Bedrock, use a token-based pricing model. This means that you pay for the number of tokens (a unit of text or code) generated or processed by the service. The more tokens you generate or process, the higher the cost.

Provisioned throughput
Some AWS generative AI services, like Amazon Polly and Amazon Transcribe, let you provision a specific amount of throughput (for example, audio or text processing capacity) in advance. Higher provisioned throughput levels typically come at a higher cost but can ensure predictable performance for time-sensitive workloads.

Custom models
AWS provides pre-trained models for various generative AI tasks, but you can also bring your own custom models or fine-tune existing models. Training and deploying custom models can incur additional costs, depending on the complexity of the model, the training data, and the compute resources required.
