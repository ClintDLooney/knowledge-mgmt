AWS offers even more in the generative AI layer. You will find a set of services and tools that unlock the power of foundation models. This includes Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, which provides a set of solutions for the most common use cases.  
  
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs from Amazon and leading AI startups available through an API. With Amazon Bedrock, you can quickly get started, experiment with FMs, privately customize them with your own data, and seamlessly integrate and deploy FMs into AWS applications. If you'd prefer to experiment with building AI applications, you can get hands-on experience by using PartyRock, an Amazon Bedrock Playground.

Finally, you have applications like Amazon Q, a generative AI–powered assistant designed for work that can be tailored for a business's data. And there is Amazon Q Developer, providing ML–powered code recommendations to accelerate development in a variety of programming languages and applications.

Each of these services is designed to empower you to harness the potential of AI and ML, driving innovation, efficiency, and growth.
