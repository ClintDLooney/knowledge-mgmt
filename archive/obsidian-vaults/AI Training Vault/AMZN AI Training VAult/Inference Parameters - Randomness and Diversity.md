This is the most common category of inference parameter. Randomness and diversity parameters influence the variation in generated responses by limiting the outputs to more likely outcomes or by changing the shape of the probability distribution of outputs. Three of the more common parameters are temperature, top k, and top p. Choose each to learn more.
