Stop sequences are special tokens or sequences of tokens that signal the model to stop generating further output. When the model encounters a stop sequence during the inference process, it will terminate the generation regardless of the maximum length setting. Stop sequences are particularly useful in tasks where the desired output length is variable or difficult to predict in advance. For example, in conversational artificial intelligence (AI) systems, the stop sequence could be an end-of-conversation token or a specific phrase that indicates the end of the response.  
  
Stop sequences can be predefined or dynamically generated based on the input or the generated output itself. In some cases, multiple stop sequences can be specified, allowing the model to stop generation upon encountering any of the defined sequences.
