This parameter controls the randomness or creativity of the model's output. A higher temperature makes the output more diverse and unpredictable, and a lower temperature makes it more focused and predictable. Temperature is set between 0 and 1. The following are examples of different temperature settings.

|Outputs are more conservative, repetitive, and focused on the most likely responses.|Outputs are more diverse, creative, and unpredictable, but might be less coherent or relevant.|

The temperature parameter in generative models is a scaling factor that controls the randomness or diversity of the generated outputs. A higher temperature value increases the probability of sampling from less likely or lower-probability output tokens, resulting in more diverse and unpredictable responses. Conversely, a lower temperature value favors the most probable outputs, leading to more deterministic and repetitive responses.
