Top k limits the number of words to the top k most probable words, regardless of their percent probabilities. For instance, if top k is set to 50, the model will only consider the 50 most likely words for the next word in the sequence, even if those 50 words only make up a small portion of the total probability distribution.

|Low top k (for example, 10)|High top k (for example, 500)|
|With a low setting, like 10, the model will only consider the 10 most probable words for the next word in the sequence. This can help the output be more focused and coherent, because the model is limited to choosing from the most probable words given the context.|With a high top k setting, like 500, the model will consider the 500 most probable words for the next word in the sequence, regardless of their individual probabilities. This can lead to more diverse and creative output, because the model has a larger pool of potential words to choose from.|
