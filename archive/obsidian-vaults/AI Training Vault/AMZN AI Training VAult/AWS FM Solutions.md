- Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that makes FMs, including Amazon Titan models, from leading AI startups and Amazon available through an API. Customers can choose from a wide range of FMs to find the model that is best suited for their use case.
- Amazon Bedrock is the most efficient way to build and scale generative AI applications with FMs.
