* AI, a set of tools for letting computers act in intelligence-like ways, is the largest circle. 
	* Machine Learning is the biggest circle inside of AI
		* Deep Learning/Neural Networks is the most important circle inside ML. (Supervised learning, A to B mappings). 
		* Other small circles inside ML that are not deep learning, ANN tools. 
	* Other small circles inside AI.
* Data Science is a cost-cutting subset of many of these tools, using tools from AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning, but not all of them. It's an overlapping circle with footprint both inside and outside the AI circle.
