Figma powers much of my work, and I wish to strengthen the platform to benefit the company, builders with disabilities, and myself. My visual impairment makes me personally accountable to my work's quality, and my experience demonstrates leadership at scale. 

I work as a TPM and accessibility leader with 13 years' experience across Amazon, Microsoft, and UW. At Amazon, I aligned 2 VPs and 30 Directors across 5 continents to drive global shipping network upgrades, managed 40+ developer sprints per year, and delivered $1.1M annual savings in North America that unlocked a further $100M initiative across the EU. I partnered with the National Federation of the Blind to resolve 200+ Amazon.com UX blockers, shipped 50+ blocker fixes to the billion-grossing Prime Day 2017 and 2018, and brought Amazon Chime to WCAG 2.1 compliance. At Microsoft, I led a compliance drive to baseline and meet accessibility standards across the company's entire web presence, and coached 175+ builders through 51 accessibility trainings. 

Below is my approach to the first 90 to 180 days of enterprise accessibility improvement for reference:
-Audit & remediation program: Establish an intake → triage → remediation pipeline with severity and risk scoring tied to WCAG 2.1 level AA (legal gold standard). Pair internal testing (JAWS/NVDA/VoiceOver, mobile readers) with vendor capacity; define SLAs and “stop-the-line” criteria for blocking issues.
-Program infrastructure & visibility: Stand up a source-of-truth dashboard (coverage, pass rates, aging defects, enterprise-blocking risks) and OKRs that ladder to product/org goals.
-Design systems integration: Partner with PM/Design leadership to bake accessibility into shared components—tokens, semantics, focus/keyboard patterns, and ARIA guidance—so downstream product squads inherit “correct by default.”
-Compliance for high-stakes customers: Formalize VPAT and enterprise RFP responses; map requirements to test evidence and ongoing regression plans.
-AI-assisted efficiency (lightweight): Where appropriate, use AI to accelerate triage (grouping like issues, suggesting alt-text drafts, flagging color contrast violations for review) while keeping humans in the loop for accuracy and nuance.

I’m based in Florida, work remotely, and can travel for onsites. I’m ready to start conversations and would be excited to help Figma lead the industry in accessible design and collaboration.

Warmly,
