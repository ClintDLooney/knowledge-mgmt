A form of [[Reinforcement Machine Learning]] which creates more sophisticated reward structures. Tthe system aims to improve the quality of outcomes (represented by the letter Q) by earning rewards for specific actions.
Q learning uses set environments called States, and Actions that can respond to the states. 
Start with a Q (outcome quality) of 0, and increment Q when an action is taken that improves its condition. Such as a customer making a purchase. 
Once set up, a Q learning algorithm searches for patterns to help increase its Q score.
