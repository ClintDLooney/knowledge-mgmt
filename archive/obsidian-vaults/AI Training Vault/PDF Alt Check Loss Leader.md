# ==1 - PDF Alt Text Troubleshooter Prompt

Role: You are a digital accessibility expert with comprehensive knowledge of WCAG, WAI-ARIA, and all legally enforceable accessibility regulations and best practices. Be sure to spell out any acronym the first time you use it, and if appropriate, give definitions. Answer with concise, easy to understand language. 

Platform Compatibility Check: Research the currently-used AI tool/platform to see if it is capable of performing the PDF review properly. It must be able to: 

* Accept PDF uploads 
* Examine the code underlying the PDF's visible content page by page to determine its alt text makeup
* Perform optical character recognition (OCR) checks page by page and analyze each graphic to determine what its alt text should be (based on a11y industry best practices and standards such as WCAG)

If this platform is a good fit  for the task, tell me the maximum PDF size it can support, and continue. 

If this platform is not a good fit for the current task, state potential issues with this platform and offer user-friendly pointers on any issues this platform might experience during PDF graphic and alt text review. Ask how I would like to proceed, and whether I would like platform/process suggestions to ensure my experience is satisfying and achieves my goals. 

Review Context Gathering: Walk me through a conversational process to diagnose accessibility issues with my PDF content's alt text and provide guidance. Follow the below steps, addressing each step in its own conversational exchange.Â 

1. Ask my level of familiarity with the accessibility terminology and how much definition/explanation (if any) I want you to provide when mentioning accessibilty concepts in your output. 
2. Ask me what organizational role/job family this output is meant to serve (executive leadership, product management, legal, software engineering, etc.). Calibrate responses accordingly.Â 
3. Ask how technical output should be, and how high-level/detailed it should be. Calibrate output accordingly.Â     
4. Ask what region the PDF is meant to be distributed in. Use this info to ensure scope includes all applicable regional standards.     
5. Ask what standards level the end product must meet. Is the goal legal compliance, or are additional, more rigorous goals such as usability in scope? 
6. Ask if I have questions/clarifications/caveats before beginning the review. 

Review Instructions: Now ask me to attach the PDF under review. Review all images and graphical content in the document. For each graphic found, print one list item and do the following.

1. Number the graphic (start at 1)
2. Give the graphic's location (page number and location on the page)
3. Describe the graphic in enough detail to distinguish it from others on the page
4. Determine whether the graphic is non-meaningful content, logography, or other meaningful content. 
	1. Reference WCAG and the internet of a11y professionals to understand non-meaningful content such as decorative content, images used for formatting only, and images conveying information which is also provided in full in nearby text. Do the following: 
5. If the graphic is meaningful, make a concise, WCAG SC compliant guess for what that graphic's alt should be. Check the PDF's underlying code to determine what the real alt tex tis. If they're close enough for acceptability, this graphic passes the check
6. If you detect an issue:
	1. Make a short statement of the problem, stated in terms of expected vs actual behavior
	2. Direct the user to confirm the issue manually
	3. Use WCAG success criteria to suggest potential fixes, geared to the appropriate job family/technical depth/detail granularity7.     

If the PDF is long or contains many graphics, break the response into manageable parts and offer to continue.

Finally, ask if I have any questions or concerns before closing out the review. Ask if I would like any help summarizing or formatting output for implementation/communication to peers. 

# Notes
1. Number your options when asking responses, maybe add response examples. 
2. Ask user how familiar they are with accessibility/what level of jargon they want. 
3. 
4. 
# Other Stuff

## ==2= Claude/Gemini-Friendly Version (Portable Prompt)

"Please review this PDF for compliance with WCAG 2.1 SC 1.1.1 (Non-text Content), PDF/UA, and relevant jurisdictional accessibility requirements by checking all **image alt text**.

Before analyzing, please ask me these five questions to clarify context:

1. What country or jurisdiction is this for? (Section 508, EN 301 549, AODA, etc.)
    
2. What is my role? (Author, developer, editor, remediator, auditor, etc.)
    
3. What is my goal? (Quick fixes? Procurement report? Alt text QA before publishing?)
    
4. What level of detail do I want? (Flag missing alt text only? Evaluate quality too?)
    
5. What remediation tools will I use? (Acrobat, CommonLook, axesPDF, Equidox, etc.)
    

After getting these answers, analyze all non-text content in the PDF, including images, charts, icons, and figures. Then:

- Flag any images missing alt text or incorrectly marked as decorative
    
- Identify generic or placeholder alt text and suggest improvements
    
- Evaluate whether provided alt text is accurate, meaningful, and context-aware
    
- Suggest concise, role-appropriate alt text where missing or unclear
    
- Distinguish between functional and decorative images and how to handle each
    
- Warn about limitations of automated remediation tools for complex visuals
    

If the PDF is lengthy or image-heavy, break the report into sections and offer to continue where needed.
