Variance in machine learning refers to how much the predictions made by a model differ from each other. It measures the spread of the predicted values.  
  

- **High Variance**: Predictions are scattered widely, meaning the model's output varies significantly with different data sets.
- **Low Variance**: Predictions are closely grouped together, showing consistency.
