**[[Machine Learning]] (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data and improve without explicit programming. It often involves building systems that map inputs (A) to outputs (B), e.g., predicting house prices based on features.

**[[Data Science]]**: The science of extracting insights and knowledge from data, often resulting in business decisions or recommendations, such as identifying trends in housing data to guide investments.

According to the lesson, “machine learning” and “data science” deliver different outcomes, for example a piece of software for a machine learning project, and a slide deck presentation for a data science project.
