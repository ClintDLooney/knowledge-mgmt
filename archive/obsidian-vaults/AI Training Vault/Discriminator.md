A neural network that uses supervised learning to classify images as real or fake. It provides feedback to the generator to help it improve its image creation.
Usable for more than just images. 

Uses a form of [[Supervised Machine Learning]] to perform [[Data Classification]], classing images for example as either real or AI fakes. Repeatedly rejects the [[Generator]]'s output and gives it feedback for iteration.
