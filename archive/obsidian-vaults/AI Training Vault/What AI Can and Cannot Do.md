ML works wellif:
1. It's a simple task/concept (for instance, about a second of effort)
2. Lots of data is available. (Both the A and B of input output mapping)
ML works poorly if 
* It's a complex concept
* The training set is small
* It's BAD at GENERALIZING. - A task uses new types of data not seen in the training set. 
	* Example: training on good well-taken x-rays, then applying the ML system to a hospital which produces flawed or idiosyncratic x-rays. 
	* 

* Can
	* Supervised learning can
		* Do most tasks taht require about 1 second of thought. 
		* 
* CanNOT
	* Supervised learning cannot
		* Predict stock prices accurately (this takes more than a second of thought)
		* Use a handful of medical textbook images to diagnose real pneumonia from chest x-rays (small training set, more than 1 second analysis)
