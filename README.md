# Master Knowledge Base

A comprehensive knowledge management repository containing multiple projects, learning initiatives, and automation systems.

## Repository Structure

### Main Projects
- **`a11y-ai/`** - Accessibility AI business with OCR tools and automation
- **`chatgpt-projects/`** - ChatGPT-related projects and experiments  
- **`obsidian-vaults/`** - Obsidian knowledge management vaults
- **`other-projects/`** - Miscellaneous projects and experiments

### Management Systems
- **`docs/`** - Master-level documentation and context
- **`scripts/`** - Cross-project automation and management scripts
- **`journal/`** - Master-level session logs and progress tracking

## Quick Start

### For Master-Level Oversight
1. Open `knowledge-mgmt.code-workspace` in Cursor
2. Run `.\scripts\master-session-start.ps1` in PowerShell
3. Copy the generated context loading prompt to your Cursor chat
4. Begin with master-level project coordination and oversight

### For Individual Project Work
1. Open the specific project workspace (e.g., `a11y-ai/a11y-ai.code-workspace`)
2. Follow the project-specific SOPs and workflows
3. Use project-specific session management scripts

## Key Features

### Context Management
- **File-based anchoring** across all projects
- **Context drift prevention** through systematic documentation
- **Automated session management** with PowerShell scripts

### Workflow Automation
- **Master-level oversight** scripts for cross-project coordination
- **Project-specific workflows** for focused development
- **Token optimization** and usage tracking

### Knowledge Preservation
- **Structured documentation** for all decisions and progress
- **Session logging** for continuity across work sessions
- **Learning tracking** for AI skills development

## Current Status

- **A11y AI Project**: OCR prototype complete, ready for testing and scaling
- **Automation Systems**: 6+ PowerShell scripts for workflow management
- **Context System**: Fully implemented file-based anchoring
- **Learning**: AI power user skills in active development

## Next Steps

1. Test OCR tool with larger, more complex documents
2. Scale accessibility business model
3. Expand knowledge management system to other projects
4. Develop advanced AI collaboration workflows
