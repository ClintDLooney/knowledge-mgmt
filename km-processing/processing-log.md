## Processing Log Entries

### 2025-01-27 - Pre-Processing Setup - IN PROGRESS

**Action**: Initial workspace setup and documentation creation
**Findings**: 
- Binary file access issue identified (Word docs, PDFs)
- Content structure mapped: 3 main categories (Chat Thread Copy Pastes, ChatGPT Canvases, Project File Uploads)
- High-relevance files identified for priority processing
**Decisions**: 
- Create comprehensive documentation framework first
- Use Word processor tool for binary file extraction
- Implement systematic file-by-file analysis approach
**Red Flags**: 
- Binary file access limitation requires tool-based extraction
- Need to determine processing approach for inaccessible files
**Next Steps**: 
- Complete documentation framework setup
- Begin file-by-file analysis with accessible content
- Address binary file processing strategy
**Learning**: 
- Documentation-first approach provides better crashproofing
- Binary file processing requires specialized tools
- Systematic approach enables better pattern recognition
