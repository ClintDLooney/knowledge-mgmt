# Knowledge Processing Methodology

## Complete 4-Phase Processing Approach

### Phase 0: Pre-Processing Setup
- Content inventory and categorization
- Workspace creation with tracking systems
- Quality assurance setup with validation checkpoints

### Phase 1: Goal Alignment & Context Setting
- Business context documentation
- Processing standards and priorities
- Red flag monitoring system

### Phase 2: Multi-Pass Content Analysis
**Pass 1: File-by-File Analysis (High Detail)**
- Complete content analysis and categorization
- Extract all relevant insights and frameworks
- Identify content belonging to multiple categories
- Create detailed extraction summary
- Flag red flags and uncertainties
- Pause for review and guidance

**Pass 2: Topic-by-Topic Synthesis**
- Identify patterns across all processed files
- Build comprehensive frameworks and SOPs
- Create cross-reference mappings
- Identify gaps and opportunities
- Develop strategic recommendations

### Phase 3: Destructive Processing
- Process each file completely in staging area
- Extract and categorize all content
- Place content in appropriate staging areas
- Update processing logs and mappings
- Pause for review at each file

### Phase 4: Integration & Documentation
- Organize staged content into final structure
- Create comprehensive business strategies
- Complete learning documentation
- Prepare for future knowledge processing

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Validation Checkpoints
- After each file analysis
- At any uncertainty or WTF moments
- When switching tasks or gears
- At potential red flags or issues
- Before major processing decisions

### Red Flag Detection Patterns
- Content that seems irrelevant or useless
- Processing approach inefficiencies
- Quality degradation or information loss
- Business alignment issues
- Technical or structural problems
- File access or format issues

### Learning Documentation Requirements
- Complete methodology documentation
- Reusable prompt templates
- Domain-agnostic processing methods
- Case study documentation
- Future knowledge processing guides

## Processing Logs & Tracking

### Required Log Files
- `processing-log.md` - Overall progress and decisions
- `extraction-mapping.md` - Content to destination mapping
- `red-flags-log.md` - Issues and resolutions
- `content-inventory.md` - File metadata and relevance scores
- `learning-documentation.md` - Methodology insights and improvements

### Log Entry Format
```markdown
## [Date] - [File/Phase] - [Status]
**Action**: [What was done]
**Findings**: [Key insights discovered]
**Decisions**: [Decisions made]
**Red Flags**: [Issues identified]
**Next Steps**: [What to do next]
**Learning**: [Methodology insights]

## Restart & Recovery Procedures

### Fresh Chat Context Loading Prompt
I need to process [knowledge-body-name] content for my [business-domain] business. Here's the complete context:

**Project Goal**: Extract business insights, frameworks, and create reusable knowledge processing SOPs from [knowledge-body-name] content.

**Current State**:
- Archive content preserved in archive/[location]/
- Processing workspace ready at km-processing/[knowledge-body-name]-copy/
- Learning documentation framework in shared/learning/knowledge-processing/

**Approach**:
1. File-by-file analysis with high detail
2. Topic-by-topic synthesis for pattern recognition
3. Destructive processing in staging area
4. Integration with [target-integration-directory]

**Key Files to Read First**:
- docs/MASTER_CONTEXT.md - Overall project context
- [business-context-file] - Business context
- km-processing/[knowledge-body-name]-copy/processing-log.md - Current progress
- shared/learning/knowledge-processing/master-sop.md - Processing methodology

**Success Criteria**: Complete conversion to actionable business strategies + comprehensive learning documentation for future knowledge processing.

**Validation**: Pause after each file, at uncertainties, and at red flags for review and guidance.

### Emergency Recovery Checklist
```markdown
## Emergency Recovery Checklist

### Environment Check
- [ ] Verify processing workspace exists
- [ ] Check processing logs for current status
- [ ] Validate staging area structure
- [ ] Confirm learning documentation framework

### Progress Assessment
- [ ] Review processing-log.md for last completed file
- [ ] Check extraction-mapping.md for current mappings
- [ ] Review red-flags-log.md for unresolved issues
- [ ] Validate content-inventory.md for file status

### Resume Processing
- [ ] Continue from last completed file
- [ ] Address any unresolved red flags
- [ ] Update processing logs with recovery actions
- [ ] Validate current approach and methodology

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Verify all extractions are complete
- [ ] Check staging area organization
