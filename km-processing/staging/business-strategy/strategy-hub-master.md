# Strategy Hub Master - Project Navigation Canvas

## Overview
This Strategy Hub is the single source of truth for navigating all Canvases and subject matter within the project. Think of it as a binder with dividers: it organizes, summarizes, and references each piece of work without duplicating detailed content.

## High-Level Project Overview

### Project Goals
The overarching goal of this project is to build a scalable ecosystem at the intersection of AI, accessibility, and digital product creation. It combines:

- **Enterprise accessibility consulting**, uniquely powered by lived experience and AI integration
- **Rapid digital product creation frameworks** that enable fast market entry and monetization
- **Strategic research** on niches, monetization paths, and scalable offers

### Project Direction
The project's direction is toward creating repeatable systems that leverage AI and lived expertise to generate revenue, authority, and long-term independence.

## Table of Contents (with Summaries)

### 1. Paid Creators Strategic Action Plan
A comprehensive business roadmap for building an AI-powered accessibility consulting business. Covers customer profiles, unique positioning, productized services, monetization strategies, traffic/growth plans, and phased implementation (foundation, execution, optimization).

### 2. PaidCreators Extraction Prompt (Master)
Core framework for transforming skills and niche insights into sellable digital products in under 60 minutes. Includes structured prompts for product ideation, offer stack creation, and sales page generation. Several variations exist, refining approaches for quick-win products and upsell pathways.

### 3. Other's Example – PaidCreators Extraction Prompt (MAIN, multiple versions)
Reference examples demonstrating how other creators have used extraction prompts to build high-selling digital products. Includes templates for product frameworks, upsell strategies, bonus stacks, and persuasive sales page copywriting.

**⚠️ Note**: Many examples reference irrelevant niches (e.g., parenting, smoking cessation, general wellness). These should be treated strictly as formatting and structural references, not as content to integrate into the AI Accessibility workflows.

### 4. 250 High Selling Niche Ideas
A master list of over 250 evergreen niches for digital product creation. Organized across categories like Health, Finance, Parenting, Marketing, Personal Development, and Emerging Trends. Serves as a brainstorming and targeting resource for product-market fit.

**⚠️ Note**: Only niches relevant to AI + accessibility should be considered for integration; unrelated niches are reference-only.

## Placeholders for Additional Canvases

### 5. VPAT Products/Services Canvas (Placeholder)
Covers potential products and services related to Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates (VPAT), targeting compliance and enterprise buyers. Purpose: define offerings that address regulatory and procurement requirements.

### 6. Developer Pain Point Solutions Canvas (Placeholder)
Explores product/service ideas that directly address common developer frustrations and inefficiencies, with a focus on accessibility and productivity enhancements. Purpose: identify scalable solutions aligned with real dev workflows.

### 7. Accessibility GPT Products & Avenues Canvas (Placeholder)
Details products/services that apply specialized GPT models to accessibility use cases. Purpose: expand on both enterprise consulting and consumer-facing opportunities.

### 8. Product Dev Roadmap Canvas (Placeholder)
Outlines sequencing and prioritization for product builds across all verticals. Purpose: serve as a tactical roadmap aligned with strategy-level planning.

### 9. Funnel Doc Canvas (Placeholder)
A working space for sales funnel architecture, including lead magnets, front-end offers, upsells, and premium consulting. Purpose: centralize funnel design across different product lines.

## Research & Resources Divider

### A. Formatting & Sales Page Examples (Reference-Only)
Includes documents like Other's Example – PaidCreators Extraction Prompt (all versions). These are valuable for structure, formatting, and copy frameworks.

**⚠️ Do not integrate example niches** (e.g., parenting, health, smoking cessation) into AI Accessibility workflows.

### B. Market/Niche Research Resources
250 High Selling Niche Ideas — Use only selectively for cross-reference; filter for relevance to AI, accessibility, compliance, and enterprise markets.

Any future competitive scans or market reports can also be organized here.

## Usage Guidelines

### Keep Lean
The Hub is for navigation and orientation only — no deep dives.

### Update Rules
Add new Canvases here as they are created. Update summaries only when scope or purpose shifts meaningfully.

### Single Source of Truth
This Hub replaces scattered navigation across chats and threads.

### Relevance Filter
External examples (e.g., unrelated industries like parenting or lifestyle products) are reference-only for formatting and structure. They should never be used as direct input into accessibility-focused workflows.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Navigation Setup
1. **Establish Hub** as single source of truth
2. **Create placeholders** for all known canvases
3. **Set up relevance filtering** system

### Phase 2: Content Organization
1. **Fill in summaries** for existing canvases
2. **Organize resources** by relevance and type
3. **Create update protocols** for new content

### Phase 3: Maintenance
1. **Regular updates** as new canvases are created
2. **Relevance checks** for new resources
3. **Navigation optimization** based on usage

## Success Metrics

### Navigation Efficiency
