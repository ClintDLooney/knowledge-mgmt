# AI A11y GPT Strategy

## Market Reality
- **Direct monetization in OpenAI's GPT Store is very limited** — most creators make $0, only a few in pilot programs earn
- **Standalone GPT revenue is modest** (likely $500–1.5k/month ceiling with heavy effort)
- **GPTs work best as lead magnets or tripwire offers** that funnel into paid toolkits, training, or consulting

## Accessibility GPT Market Insights

### Where Demand is Real (based on dev forums & research):
- **Mobile accessibility** (screen readers, gestures, ARIA/focus issues)
- **Web SPAs and dynamic UIs** (focus management, live regions)
- **Accessibility QA/testing guidance**

### Strategic Approach:
- **Monolithic GPT = too broad, risks dilution**
- **Several niche GPTs (2–3) aimed at specific problems = better traction, cross-sell potential**

## Skills & Feasibility Assessment

### Your Competitive Edge:
- **13 years a11y expertise**
- **Enterprise background**
- **Lived experience**

### Gap Analysis:
- **Little mobile dev experience** → risky if promising code fixes
- **AI can help**: Learn patterns and curate solutions, but you'll need developer validation for complex/edge cases

### Strategic Zones:
- **Safe zone**: Audit, compliance, testing, training GPTs
- **Stretch zone**: Dev Copilot GPTs that output code — need validation support

## Revenue Projections & Ramp-Up Reality

### Month 1: MVP GPT Launch
- **Action**: Launch 1-2 audit/QA GPTs (low dev risk)
- **Monetization**: Gumroad/Stripe link gating
- **Expected Revenue**: $0–100

### Months 2–3: Promotion Phase
- **Action**: Promote to network (LinkedIn, ex-colleagues, accessibility/AI groups)
- **Target**: ~100–200 installs, ~5–10 buyers
- **Expected Revenue**: $150–500

### Months 6–12: Expansion Phase
- **Action**: If niche GPTs resonate, bundle and expand
- **Expected Revenue**: $500–1.5k

### Conclusion:
**GPT-only revenue is modest; value comes from funneling to bigger offers**

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: MVP Launch
1. **Launch MVP GPTs**: Start with 1–2 audit/QA GPTs (low dev risk)
2. **Gate Simply**: Use Gumroad/Stripe for access to unlisted GPT links
3. **Promote to Network**: LinkedIn, ex-colleagues, accessibility/AI groups
4. **Test Demand**: See if people pay for practical GPTs

### Phase 2: Expansion
1. **Expand Later**: Add dev-facing GPTs with validation help
2. **Always Funnel**: Point GPT users to upsells (toolkits, quick-start kits, consulting)

## Key Success Factors
- Focus on niche problems rather than broad solutions
- Leverage existing expertise in audit/compliance/testing
- Use GPTs as lead magnets for higher-value offerings
- Build validation support for code-generating GPTs
- Maintain focus on practical, actionable solutions
