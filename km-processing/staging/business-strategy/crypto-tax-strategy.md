# Crypto Tax Minimization Strategy

## Core Strategy Overview
**Approach**: Treat farming as personal investment (not business)
**Rationale**: Farming rewards and trading gains are classified as investment income, not business revenue
**Benefit**: Skip LLC complexity unless selling products/services

## Tax Classification Framework

### Income Types
- **Staking/Farming Rewards** → Ordinary income at fair market value when received
- **Swaps, Trades, Exits from Liquidity Pools** → Capital gains (short- or long-term depending on holding period)

### Filing Requirements
- **Individual Return**: Form 1040 + Schedule D + applicable crypto reporting forms
- **Automation**: Use crypto tax software (CoinTracker, Koinly, TokenTax) for reporting

## Tax Optimization Strategies

### 1. Long-Term Holding Strategy
- **Benefit**: Tokens held 12+ months qualify for long-term capital gains rates (0–20%)
- **Contrast**: Short-term gains taxed at ordinary income rate (22–37%)
- **Action**: Hold rewards for >12 months if you believe in token's future

### 2. Loss Harvesting
- **Strategy**: Sell underperforming tokens at a loss to offset gains
- **Benefit**: Capital losses offset capital gains dollar-for-dollar
- **Carryover**: Up to $3,000/year can offset ordinary income, excess carried forward
- **Action**: Review portfolio for harvest candidates before year-end

### 3. Tax-Advantaged Accounts
- **Options**: Self-Directed IRA or Solo 401(k) with crypto-friendly custodian
- **Benefits**: Gains grow tax-deferred (IRA/401k) or tax-free (Roth)
- **Caution**: Not all custodians allow active DeFi protocols

### 4. State & Residency Planning
- **Tax-Free States**: Florida, Texas, Wyoming, Nevada, Washington, South Dakota, Alaska
- **International Options**: Portugal, UAE, El Salvador (0% crypto tax)
- **Action**: Factor tax residency into wealth strategy if relocation is possible

### 5. Gas Fees & Transaction Costs
- **Deductibility**: Deductible against gains when directly tied to acquiring/disposing tokens
- **Example**: Gas fees for swapping can increase cost basis or reduce proceeds
- **Action**: Keep detailed records of fees for every transaction

### 6. Strategic Timing of Sales
- **Strategy**: Spread sales across tax years to stay in lower bracket
- **Example**: Sell half of large position in December, half in January
- **Action**: Run year-end simulations with tax software or CPA

## Compliance Best Practices

### Record Keeping
- **Separate Wallets**: Farming vs. personal spending for easier tracking
- **Documentation**: Keep notes/screenshots of major moves
- **Reconciliation**: Use crypto tax software monthly

### Professional Support
- **Annual Check-in**: Consult crypto-savvy CPA annually
- **Threshold**: Especially important if yield >$20k
- **Compliance**: Ensure all reporting requirements are met

## What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Mistakes
- **Don't**: Run farming through LLC just to "write off" education
- **Don't**: Mix personal and business wallets if offering services later
- **Don't**: Ignore reporting (crypto transactions leave blockchain trail)

## Quick Action Checklist

### Immediate Steps
1. **Decide**: Farm as individual (default, simplest)
2. **Software**: Pick crypto tax software and connect wallets
3. **Tracking**: Record fair market value of rewards on date earned
4. **Planning**: Keep some positions >12 months for long-term rates

### Year-End Optimization
1. **Loss Harvesting**: Harvest losses where useful before Dec 31

3. **Professional Review**: Book crypto CPA for compliance + optimization

## Strategic Benefits
