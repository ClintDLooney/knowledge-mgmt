## Key Strategic Components

### 1. Brand Name Candidates Analysis
**Primary Candidates Evaluated**:
- Accessible Intelligence (prioritized #1)
- Access AI (prioritized #2) 
- Accessible AI (prioritized #3)

**Decision Criteria**:
- Professional credibility for tech industry
- Domain availability across preferred TLDs
- Social media handle consistency
- Trademark risk assessment
- Business entity name availability

### 2. Domain Strategy Framework

**Preferred TLD Hierarchy**:
1. `.com` - Primary choice for credibility
2. `.ai` - Industry-appropriate for AI business
3. `.tech` - Professional tech sector positioning
4. `.io` - Developer/tech community acceptance
5. `.biz` - Fallback option only

**Rejected TLDs**: `.org`, `.co`, `.xyz`, `.club` (deemed unprofessional/hobbyist)

**Domain Qualification Strategy**:
- Group suffix: `accessibleaigroup.com`
- Labs suffix: `accessibleailabs.com`
- Systems suffix: `accessibleaisystems.com`
- Tech suffix: `accessibleaitech.com`

### 3. Professional Credibility Considerations

**Hyphenated Domains - Strategic Rejection**:
- Perception: "Couldn't get the real one"
- Trust issues: Users forget hyphens, land on competitor sites
- SEO impact: Indirect negative effects through user behavior
- Resale value: Almost never appreciate in value
- Professional positioning: Undermines authority in business context

**Acceptable Qualifiers for Brand Extensions**:
- HQ (headquarters implication)
- Labs (research/development focus)
- Tech (technology emphasis)
- Group (professional organization)
- Systems (enterprise positioning)

### 4. Domain Research Methodology

**Systematic Batch Testing Approach**:
1. Use instantdomainsearch.com for consistent data
2. Process domains in manageable batches (6-8 at a time)
3. Capture both main results and secondary detail pages
4. Parse registrar status (Available/Taken/Premium/Squatted)
5. Record expiration dates and registration details
6. Flag trademark conflicts immediately

**Registration Status Categories**:
- **Available**: Standard pricing, immediate registration
- **Taken**: Registered with privacy protection or active use
- **Premium**: Aftermarket pricing, broker services required
- **Squatted**: Parked domains with premium pricing

### 5. Social Media Handle Strategy

**Platform Priority Order**:
1. LinkedIn (business networking)
2. X/Twitter (thought leadership)
3. YouTube (content/education)
4. Instagram (visual content)
5. TikTok (optional, younger demographics)

**Consistency Requirements**:
- Identical handles across all platforms preferred
- Acceptable variations when identical unavailable:
  - Brand + HQ
  - Brand + Labs
  - Brand + Group
  - Brand + Tech

### 6. Legal and Trademark Considerations

**Risk Assessment Framework**:
- **üö´ Hard Block**: Active use by another company in tech/accessibility space
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate Risk**: Other industries or expired trademarks
- **‚úÖ Clear**: No obvious conflicts detected

**Entity Registration Planning**:
- Florida Sunbiz registry checks required
- Exact matches and "confusingly similar" names flagged
- Business entity name must align with chosen brand
- No filing until final name selection confirmed

### 7. Competitive Research Insights

**Market Positioning Analysis**:
- "Access AI" identified as higher collision risk (common phrase)
- Longer form names (Accessible Intelligence) have lower conflict probability
- Industry-specific terms provide better defensibility
- Premium domain market shows high valuations for AI-related terms

1. Primary domain availability (.com priority)
2. Social handle consistency across platforms
3. Trademark clearance (USPTO/WIPO checks)
4. Professional credibility factors
5. Business entity name availability
6. Future expansion considerations

**Cost Considerations**:
- `.com` domains: $11.99-21.99 first year
- `.ai` domains: $49.99 first year (2-year term required)
- `.io` domains: $59.99-77.99 first year
