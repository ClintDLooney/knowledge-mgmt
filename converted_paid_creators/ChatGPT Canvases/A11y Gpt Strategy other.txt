📌 Accessibility GPT Strategy — Key Takeaways

Market Reality

Direct GPT monetization is limited: Only a handful of creators make money directly from OpenAI’s store, most earn $0.

GPTs as products: Standalone revenue is modest ($500–1.5k/mo ceiling with heavy promotion). GPTs work best as lead magnets or tripwires into higher-ticket offers.

Accessibility GPT Market Insights

Demand signals exist: Developers struggle with mobile a11y (screen readers, focus management, ARIA live regions). Compliance officers, auditors, and SMEs also need help.

Niche GPTs are stronger than one big tool:

Audit Assistant: Quick WCAG scans + checklists.

Dev Copilot: Focus/ARIA/fix guidance.

Training Bot: Interactive a11y learning.

Risk Analyzer: ADA/WCAG exposure framing.

Monolithic GPT = broad, generic → lower traction. Portfolio of 2–3 focused GPTs = better odds to find a winner.

Skills & Feasibility

Your strengths: Deep a11y experience, enterprise credibility, lived perspective.

Your gap: Little mobile dev experience → risk if GPT promises code-level fixes.

AI can help: You can learn enough mobile a11y patterns to curate and guide, but not fully replace developer validation.

Strategic fit: Stay in your lane as an accessibility strategist + AI orchestrator. Use AI to accelerate knowledge, but collaborate for code-heavy outputs.

Realistic Ramp-Up

Month 1: MVP GPT launch + Gumroad/Stripe link gating → $0–100.

Months 2–3: With steady promotion, 100–200 installs → 5–10 paid → $150–500/mo.

Months 6–12: If niche GPTs gain traction, bundle them → $500–1.5k/mo.

Ceiling: GPT-only income modest. Bigger opportunity = funnel into toolkits, consulting.

Next Steps (High-Level)

Start Small: Launch 1–2 “safe zone” GPTs (audit/QA focus, not code-first).

MVP Gating: Use Gumroad/Stripe to sell access to unlisted GPTs.

Validate Demand: Promote via LinkedIn + network, see if people pay for practical GPTs.

Expand: Add dev-facing Copilot GPT only if you can validate/curate solutions credibly.

Funnel: Always point GPT users toward your upsells (toolkits, quick-start kits, consulting).
