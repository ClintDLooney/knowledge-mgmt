Section 2: Availability Research Process

Priority order ‚Äî stop and switch names if an early step hard-blocks you. Use ‚úÖ CHECK to track progress as each sub-step is completed.

Step 1 (Highest Priority): Domain / TLD Search

Goal: Secure a clean primary domain (ideally .com; .ai acceptable).

Tools: InstantDomainSearch, Namecheap, GoDaddy (for WHOIS lookup).

Sub-steps: - [ ] 1.1 Search exact name on .com. Record status: Free / Taken / Premium / Parked. - [ ] 1.2 If .com is taken, check .ai, .co, .io, .org, .biz. - [ ] 1.3 If primary is taken, check smart variants (document results): - Hyphenated: accessible-intelligence.com, accessible-ai.com - Shortened: accessintel.com, accessintel.ai - With qualifiers: getaccessibleintelligence.com, useaccessai.com, accessaihq.com, accesspoint.ai - [ ] 1.4 Use WHOIS to check registration details for taken domains ‚Üí note owner privacy, expiry date, and if broker/purchase option exists. - [ ] 1.5 Decide buy / backorder / move on. If viable, reserve/register immediately.

Record format (example): - Primary: accessibleintelligence.com ‚Üí Taken (expires 2027, private registration, broker service $99.99) - Alternates: accessibleintelligence.ai ‚Üí [status]; accessintel.com ‚Üí [status]

Step 2: Social Handle Search (Consistency across platforms)

Goal: Lock consistent, professional handles (prefer short & readable).

Tools: Direct platform check + Namechk (quick scan).

Canonical handles: - Accessible Intelligence ‚Üí @AccessibleIntel or @AccessIntel - Access AI ‚Üí @AccessAI or @AccessAIHQ - Accessible AI ‚Üí @AccessibleAI

Sub-steps: - [ ] 2.1 LinkedIn ‚Üí Search Companies ‚Üí confirm page slug availability. - [ ] 2.2 X (Twitter) ‚Üí Visit twitter.com/<handle> ‚Üí ‚ÄúThis account doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù = available. - [ ] 2.3 YouTube ‚Üí Check youtube.com/@<handle>. - [ ] 2.4 Instagram ‚Üí Visit instagram.com/<handle>. - [ ] 2.5 TikTok (optional) ‚Üí tiktok.com/@<handle>. - [ ] 2.6 Threads ‚Üí tied to Instagram, confirm once IG handle secured. - [ ] 2.7 GitHub (optional/dev credibility) ‚Üí github.com/<handle>. - [ ] 2.8 Reddit (optional/community) ‚Üí reddit.com/u/<handle> and consider r/<brand>.

Fallback patterns if exact is taken: Add suffixes (HQ, AI, Labs, Team, Co), separators (_, .), avoid random numbers.

Step 3: Trademark Scan (USPTO first, then WIPO)

Goal: Avoid conflicts that could force a rebrand later.

Tools: USPTO TESS, WIPO Global Brand Database, Google search.

Sub-steps: - [ ] 3.1 USPTO ‚Üí Word Mark Search ‚Üí exact phrase, then close variants. - [ ] 3.2 Review relevant classes: IC 009 (software), 035 (business), 041 (training), 042 (tech services). - [ ] 3.3 Google search ‚Üí check first 2 pages for active use of the name. - [ ] 3.4 WIPO Global Brand Database ‚Üí quick global scan. - [ ] 3.5 Rate risk: None / Moderate / High.

(Not legal advice; for high-risk names, consult an attorney.)

Step 4: Florida Business Registry (Sunbiz)

Goal: Ensure the legal entity name is distinguishable/available in Florida.

Tool: Sunbiz (Florida Division of Corporations) Name Search.

Sub-steps: - [ ] 4.1 Search exact name + close variants. - [ ] 4.2 Note Active/Inactives that may block/confuse. Florida requires distinguishable names. - [ ] 4.3 Decide entity type: - LLC ‚Üí flexible, common for solo/SMB. - C-Corp ‚Üí if raising VC funding. - LLC taxed as S-Corp ‚Üí possible tax optimization once profitable. - [ ] 4.4 If exact name unavailable: register under alternate and file DBA/Fictitious Name.

Step 5: Decision & Action

Goal: Choose the winner and lock it down.

Criteria: - Primary/strong alternate domain is available. - 2+ core social handles available (LinkedIn + X + YouTube preferred). - Trademark risk is None/Low. - Sunbiz shows no blocking conflict.

Sub-steps: - [ ] 5.1 Select the winner. - [ ] 5.2 Purchase domain(s) + enable auto-renew. - [ ] 5.3 Claim social handles + set placeholders. - [ ] 5.4 Form Florida LLC (or chosen entity). - [ ] 5.5 Optional: File trademark application (after use).
