Accessibility GPT Strategy — Summary & Next Steps

Market Reality

Direct monetization in OpenAI’s GPT Store is very limited — most creators make $0, only a few in pilot programs earn.

Standalone GPT revenue is modest (likely $500–1.5k/month ceiling with heavy effort).

GPTs work best as lead magnets or tripwire offers that funnel into paid toolkits, training, or consulting.

Accessibility GPT Market Insights

Where demand is real (based on dev forums & research):

Mobile accessibility (screen readers, gestures, ARIA/focus issues).

Web SPAs and dynamic UIs (focus management, live regions).

Accessibility QA/testing guidance.

Monolithic GPT = too broad, risks dilution.

Several niche GPTs (2–3) aimed at specific problems = better traction, cross-sell potential.

Skills & Feasibility

Your edge: 13 years a11y expertise, enterprise background, lived experience.

Your gap: Little mobile dev experience → risky if promising code fixes.

AI can help: Learn patterns and curate solutions, but you’ll need developer validation for complex/edge cases.

Safe zone: Audit, compliance, testing, training GPTs.

Stretch zone: Dev Copilot GPTs that output code — need validation support.

Ramp-Up Reality

Month 1: MVP GPT launch, Gumroad/Stripe link gating → $0–100.

Months 2–3: Promotion → ~100–200 installs, ~5–10 buyers → $150–500.

Months 6–12: If niche GPTs resonate, bundle → $500–1.5k.

Conclusion: GPT-only revenue is modest; value comes from funneling to bigger offers.

Next Steps

Launch MVP GPTs: Start with 1–2 audit/QA GPTs (low dev risk).

Gate Simply: Use Gumroad/Stripe for access to unlisted GPT links.

Promote to Network: LinkedIn, ex-colleagues, accessibility/AI groups.

Test Demand: See if people pay for practical GPTs.

Expand Later: Add dev-facing GPTs with validation help.

Always Funnel: Point GPT users to upsells (toolkits, quick-start kits, consulting).
